# paosinuga_curve.py
This module implements the custom Paosinuga Curve based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). The Paosinuga Curve is designed to be used in cryptographic operations, including key generation, encryption, and signature verification. 
The implementation covers the following aspects:


Key Components:
Curve Operations:

Point Addition: Implements the algorithm for adding two points on the elliptic curve.
Scalar Multiplication: Implements the algorithm for multiplying a point on the curve by a scalar value.


Key Features:
Custom Parameters: Uses custom elliptic curve parameters specific to the Paosinuga Curve, making it distinct from standard curves like secp256k1 or P-384.


Modular Arithmetic: Utilizes modular arithmetic operations to ensure all computations are performed within the finite field defined by the curve's parameters.
Secure Point Operations: Implements secure methods for point addition and scalar multiplication to support cryptographic operations.


Usage:
This module is intended for use in cryptographic systems that require custom elliptic curves. It provides the necessary functions for creating and manipulating elliptic curve points, which can be used in various cryptographic schemes, including digital signatures and key exchange protocols.

Usage:
from paosinuga_curve import PaosinugaCurve

# Initialize the curve with custom parameters
curve = PaosinugaCurve(p=..., a=..., b=...)

# Define points on the curve
P = (x1, y1)
Q = (x2, y2)

# Add two points
R = curve.add_points(P, Q)

# Multiply a point by a scalar
S = curve.scalar_mult(k, P)



Dependencies:
None: This module does not have external dependencies and can be used as a standalone component for elliptic curve operations.
